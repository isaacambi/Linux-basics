1. What is the IP address of the DNS Server used in this system?
solution
run: cat /etc/resolv.conf and look at the server's IP address

2. Which file is responsible for host file-based DNS resolution?
solution
The answer is /etc/hosts. Check this file and inspect the entries.

3. What is the configuration file used for the DNS Server?
solution
The answer is /etc/resolv.conf. You can see the DNS Server configuration in this file.

4. Change the DNS Server to google's DNS which is 8.8.8.8

bob's password is caleston123.
solution
Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and change the nameserver IP to 8.8.8.8
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

5. Which order is used currently to resolve an IP address in the system?

Check the nsswitch.conf file
solution
Run: grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf, since the files precede the dns option, 
it will first check host file
hosts: files dns

6. Change the order to DNS first and then hosts.
solution
Update /etc/nsswitch.conf and change the line to hosts:   dns files

7. Which search domain is configured in this system ?

Inspect the DNS configuration file.
solution
check for the search domain in /etc/resolv.conf. It is set to caleston.ca

NETWORKING BASICS
1. What is the IP Address assigned to Bob's Laptop?
solution
Run: ip a and check the IP address assigned (besides the localhost 127.0.0.1)

2. What is the name of the interface that has this IP (from the previous question) address assigned?
solution
Run: ip a and check the interfaces to which the IP's is assigned or
Run: ip link

3. What is the default gateway configured in the system?
solution
Run: ip r and check the GW assigned to default route.
It should be 172.16.238.1

4. We have an apache which should be accessible on devapp01-web.

This server runs on port 80 on the server and should be accessible from Bob's laptop.

5. However, something seems to be wrong with the network!
Check if you are able to connect to the HTTP port 80 on the server devapp01-web from Bob's laptop?

Run a Telnet port 80 on devapp01-web to test.
solution
No

6. Are you able to ping devapp01-web server?
solution
Run: sudo ping devapp01-web

7. Luckily, this webserver has two interfaces. The second interface is on another 
network and is identified by the name devapp01. Check if you are able to ping devapp01

Is ping working now?
solution
Run: sudo ping devapp01

8. Let's troubleshoot from the other end. SSH to the webserver by running ssh devapp01

Use Bob's default password: caleston123

9. Inspect the interface eth0 on devapp01, is it UP?
solution
No

10.Bring up the eth0 interface
solution
Run: sudo ip link set dev eth0 up

11. While we are at it, there is also a missing default route on the server devapp01.

Add the default route via eth0 gateway.
solution

To add the default route via eth0 gateway, run the following command:

sudo ip r add default via 172.16.238.1


To delete the default route using the ip r command, you can use the following command:

sudo ip r del default


This command removes the default route from the routing table. Make sure to run the
 command with appropriate permissions, such as using sudo, to have the necessary privileges
 to modify the routing table.
