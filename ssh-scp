SH AND SCP
1. Which port number does the SSH service use by default?

Bob's default password is caleston123
solution
port 22

2. If you run ssh devapp01 in the terminal, which user are you using to connect to the server?

If unsure, try it out on the terminal.
solution
If no user is specified with the ssh command, the connection will be attempted with the logged-in user which is bob
(the current user)

3. Now, let's set up password-less ssh between Bob's laptop and the Dev Application server devapp01.

We will make use of bob's user account that has been created in the application server.

It uses the same default password: caleston123

4. First, generate the SSH key-pair using the ssh-keygen command in the caleston-lp10 server.

Key Type - RSA
solution
Run: ssh-keygen -t rsa

Use all default options by keying in enter whenever prompted.

5. The public key created using the previous command is:
solution
/home/bob/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

6. Copy the public key to the target server devapp01.

Make use of the ssh-copy-id command
solution
Run: ssh-copy-id bob@devapp01

Enter the password when prompted.

7. Which file on the target server is the public key copied in to?
solution
The public key is added to the authorized_keys file under /home/bob/.ssh directory

8. Finally, copy the file /home/bob/caleston-code.tar.gz from Bob's laptop to the server devapp01

Copy the file to Bob's home directory.
solution
Run: scp /home/bob/caleston-code.tar.gz devapp01:/home/bob
