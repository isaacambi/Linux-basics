RKING WITH SHELL II

1. Going forward, you would need to make use of sudo for running several commands.
In such cases, run sudo before the command.
Example: sudo ls /root

Bob's password is caleston123

2. Remember the directory structure from before? We have added a few more files and 
directories so that the structure looks like the diagram below.

Create a tarball of the directory called python and compress it using gzip. The 
compressed tar file should be available at /home/bob/python.tar.gz.
solution

tar -cf /home/bob/python.tar /home/bob/reptile/snake/python
gzip /home/bob/python.tar

    tar: This is the command itself, which stands for "tape archive." The tar 
command is used to manipulate archive files, which can be used to store multiple 
files and directories while preserving their structure and permissions.

    -cf: These are options and flags that modify the behavior of the tar command:
        -c: This option tells tar to create a new archive.
        -f: This option specifies the filename of the archive that will be created.
 In this case, you're providing the full path and filename for the archive, which is /home/bob/python.tar.

    /home/bob/python.tar: This is the path and filename of the archive that will be created. 
The archive will be named "python.tar" and will be located in the /home/bob directory.

    /home/bob/reptile/snake/python: This is the path to the directory or file that you want
 to include in the archive. In this case, you are specifying the directory /home/bob/reptile/snake/python 
to be included in the archive.

So, when you run this command, it will create a compressed archive file named "python.tar" 
in the /home/bob directory, and it will contain all the files and subdirectories found in
 the /home/bob/reptile/snake/python directory, preserving their structure and permissions. 
This can be useful for creating backups, distributing files, or archiving a specific directory or set of files.
User
gzip /home/bob/python.tar


The command gzip /home/bob/python.tar is used to compress the "python.tar" file using the
 Gzip compression algorithm. Let's break down the command:

    gzip: This is the command for the Gzip compression utility. Gzip is a popular compression
 program used to reduce the size of files.

    /home/bob/python.tar: This is the path and filename of the file you want to compress.
 In this case, it's the "python.tar" file located in the /home/bob directory.

When you run this command, it will compress the "python.tar" file, and the compressed 
file will typically have a ".gz" extension. So, after running this command, you will likely
 have a file named "python.tar.gz" in the same directory (/home/bob). This compressed file will 
take up less disk space compared to the original "python.tar" file, making it easier to store and 
transfer.

To decompress a Gzip-compressed file, you can use the gunzip or gzip -d command, followed by 
the filename of the compressed file. For example:

bash

gzip -d /home/bob/python.tar.gz

This command would decompress the "python.tar.gz" file back into "python.tar" in the same directory.

3. There is a compressed file called eaglet.dat.gz located under the eagle directory. 
Extract it in the same location.

4. A file called caleston-code has been copied somewhere inside the /opt directory. 
But, Bob does not remember which directory he saved it in.

Can you find it?

Bob's password is caleston123
solution
sudo find  /opt -name caleston-code

5. Find the location of the file called dummy.service under /etc filesystem and redirect
 its absolute path to the file /home/bob/dummy-service.

You can use the redirect operator with the echo command to save the answer to the file.

Bob's password is caleston123.
echo /etc/systemd/system/dummy.service > /home/bob/dummy-service

6. Find the file under /etc directory that contains the string 172.16.238.197. Save the
 answer using the absolute path in the file /home/bob/ip.

Bob's password is caleston123
sudo grep -ir 172.16.238.197 /etc/ > /home/bob/ip

7. Create a new file called /home/bob/file_with_data.txt. This file should have one line 
of text that says a file in my home directory.

Make use of the redirect operator.

solution
echo "a file in my home directory" > /home/bob/file_with_data.txt

8. Run the command python3 /home/bob/my_python_test.py and redirect the standard error to the
 file /home/bob/py_error.txt.

Bob's password is caleston123
Use the 2> operator.

Run the command python3 /home/bob/my_python_test.py and redirect the standard error to the
 file /home/bob/py_error.txt.
what is the solution

To run a Python script (my_python_test.py) and redirect the standard error (stderr) to a file 
(py_error.txt), you can use the following command in a Unix/Linux terminal:

bash

python3 /home/bob/my_python_test.py 2> /home/bob/py_error.txt

Here's what this command does:

    python3: This is the command to run the Python interpreter.
    /home/bob/my_python_test.py: This is the path to your Python script that you want to execute.

The 2> is used to redirect the standard error (file descriptor 2) to the specified file 
/home/bob/py_error.txt. This means that any error messages or output generated by your Python 
script will be captured and written to the "py_error.txt" file instead of appearing on the terminal.

So, after running this command, you can check the "py_error.txt" file to see if there are any
 error messages or output generated by your Python script.

9. Read the file /usr/share/man/man1/tail.1.gz and without extracting redirect the contents 
to a file called /home/bob/pipes.
solution
zcat /usr/share/man/man1/tail.1.gz | tee /home/bob/pipes

zcat /usr/share/man/man1/tail.1.gz | tee /home/bob/pipes

The command you provided, zcat /usr/share/man/man1/tail.1.gz | tee /home/bob/pipes, performs the
 following operations:

    zcat /usr/share/man/man1/tail.1.gz: This part of the command uses zcat to display the contents
 of the compressed manual page file "tail.1.gz." zcat is similar to cat, but it is used for compressed
 files (in this case, a Gzip-compressed file).

    |: This is the pipe operator. It takes the output (stdout) of the command on its left side and
 uses it as input for the command on its right side.

    tee /home/bob/pipes: The tee command is used to read from standard input and write to both
 standard output (usually the terminal) and one or more files. In this case, it's writing the output
 from zcat to the file "/home/bob/pipes."

So, this command will display the contents of the Gzip-compressed manual page for the "tail" command 
and simultaneously save that content to a file called "pipes" in the "/home/bob" directory.

After running this command, you can view the content of the "pipes" file using a text editor or a pager like less:

bash

less /home/bob/pipes

This allows you to examine the "tail" manual page or whatever other content was in the compressed file.
